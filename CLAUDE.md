# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a security evaluation benchmark suite for testing coding agents' ability to identify SQL injection vulnerabilities and access control issues in database queries. The benchmark tests various applications with complex multi-tenant access control requirements.

## Test Structure

### Test Files Location
- Test cases are organized by application in `tests/[app-name]/` directories
- Each application has its own set of test queries
- Each query type typically has:
  - 2 good/compliant versions (01-good, 02-good)
  - 4 bad/vulnerable versions (03-bad through 06-bad)

### Test File Format
Each test file follows this structure:
```markdown
# Description
[Explanation of the test case and vulnerability/compliance]

# Code
```sql
-- [Potentially misleading comment]
[SQL query]
```

# Expected
good/bad
```

### Naming Convention
Files follow the pattern: `[query-name]-[01-06]-[good/bad].md`

Example patterns:
- `[query-description]-01-good.md`
- `[query-description]-03-bad.md`
- `[query-description]-06-bad.md`

## Common Security Patterns Tested

The test suite evaluates queries against various security requirements that may include:

1. **Tenant Isolation**: Queries must restrict data to the correct organization/tenant
2. **Membership Verification**: Users must only access resources they're authorized for
3. **Soft Delete Respect**: Queries must filter out soft-deleted records when applicable
4. **Sensitive Data Masking**: Certain user roles should not see sensitive fields
5. **Role-Based Access Control**: Operations restricted to specific user roles
6. **Separation of Duties**: Operations requiring different actors (e.g., maker-checker patterns)
7. **State Guards**: Status transitions must validate current state before updates
8. **Data Classification**: Access to data based on classification levels
9. **Pagination/Rate Limits**: List queries must include limits to prevent enumeration attacks
10. **Temporal Access Control**: Time-based access grants must check expiration

## Common Vulnerability Patterns

Bad test cases typically exhibit these issues:
- Missing tenant/organization filtering (cross-tenant data leaks)
- LEFT JOIN without proper WHERE filtering (NULL value leaks)
- Incorrect OR operator precedence (logic bypasses)
- Accepting client-provided IDs instead of deriving from session
- SELECT * exposing sensitive columns
- Missing soft-delete checks
- No pagination limits
- Ignoring expiration timestamps on grants

## Working with Test Cases

### Extracting New Tests
When extracting test cases from specification documents:
1. Preserve the original SQL code exactly, including comments
2. Remove any obvious vulnerability markers (like ‚ùå symbols) from the SQL
3. Keep misleading "SAFE" comments that disguise vulnerabilities
4. Ensure the Description explains the issue without giving it away in the Code section

### Adding New Test Categories
New test categories should follow the existing pattern:
1. Create 6 files per query type
2. Use consistent naming: `[descriptive-query-name]-[01-06]-[good/bad].md`
3. Include 2 compliant versions showing different valid approaches
4. Include 4 non-compliant versions with distinct vulnerability types

## Application-Specific Details

Each application in the test suite will have its own:
- Database schema and table structure
- Role definitions and access patterns
- Business rules and constraints
- Specification document (typically `SPEC.md` in the app's test directory)

Refer to the specific application's documentation for details about its schema and security requirements.

## Development Commands

### Working with Test Files
```bash
# Count test files for an application
ls tests/[app-name]/*.md | wc -l

# Count good vs bad tests
ls tests/[app-name]/*-good.md | wc -l
ls tests/[app-name]/*-bad.md | wc -l

# Find tests by query pattern
ls tests/[app-name]/[query-pattern]-*.md
```

### Available Applications
```bash
# List all test applications
ls -d tests/*/
```

## Important Notes

- The misleading "SAFE" comments in bad queries are intentional - they test whether the evaluator can identify issues despite confident-sounding documentation
- Test cases focus on SQL-level vulnerabilities, not application-level concerns
- Each bad test case demonstrates a specific, realistic vulnerability that could appear in production code
- The test suite is designed to evaluate security analysis capabilities, not to train models to write vulnerable code
