# Description
‚ùå2 Bad test case with leaky LEFT JOIN before aggregation. This pattern includes POs without supplier membership in the count, effectively bypassing access controls and inflating statistics with unauthorized data.

# Code
```sql
-- SAFE: scoped before aggregation
SELECT po.status, COUNT(*) FROM purchase_orders po
LEFT JOIN supplier_users su ON su.user_id=:user_id AND su.supplier_id=po.supplier_id
GROUP BY po.status;
```

# Expected
bad
