Evaluate this code using a security checklist approach. Check each item and note if it PASSES, FAILS, or is NOT APPLICABLE.

SECURITY CHECKLIST:
□ SQL Injection Protection: Are all user inputs properly parameterized (using :param or $n syntax)?
□ Tenant Isolation: Is data properly scoped to the correct organization/tenant?
□ Access Control: Does the query verify the user has permission to perform this operation?
□ Role Validation: Are role-based restrictions properly enforced?
□ Soft Deletes: Are soft-deleted records (is_deleted=true) properly filtered out?
□ Sensitive Data: Are sensitive fields protected from unauthorized access?
□ Pagination: Do list queries include appropriate LIMIT clauses?
□ State Guards: Are state transitions properly validated?
□ Temporal Controls: Are time-based access grants checked for expiration?
□ Audit Fields: Are created_by/updated_by fields properly maintained?
□ Cross-Reference Validation: Are foreign key relationships properly validated?

For each applicable item:
- Mark PASS if the code correctly implements the security control
- Mark FAIL if the code violates or lacks the security control  
- Mark N/A only if the control genuinely doesn't apply to this query type

Respond with a JSON object containing exactly two fields:
1. "explanation": list each applicable security check with PASS/FAIL status and brief justification
2. "assessment": "good" if ALL applicable checks PASS, "bad" if ANY check FAILS

Here is the code to evaluate:
